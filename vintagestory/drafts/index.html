<p>
	This mod adds a draft-based crafting system. Instead of a crafting grid, a drawing is used that is assembled from several components (drafts) located on the canvas.
</p>
<p>The mod adds several things that implement this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drafting table - used to create a drawing and assemble an item.</li>
	<li>Recipes - essentially blueprints for assembling an item.</li>
	<li>Drafts - pieces of information obtained in the process of interaction with the world. A drawing is then assembled from these pieces. Each player can have their own list of drafts studied.</li>
	<li>Triggers - add a draft to the player when conditions are met.</li>
</ul>
