<h3>Drafts</h3>
<p>Drafts are pieces used to create blueprints on the drafting table.</p>
<p>The draft consists of an image, a shape, and a list of input and output ports.</p>
<p>The draft shape consists of cells, and each cell can have inputs and outputs. A draft can have a shape of any complexity, but shapes that are too large may not fit on some canvases.</p>
<p>Drafts are individual for each player, and are added to the player using triggers.</p>

<h3>Adding draft</h3>
<p>Drafts can be added by implementing the <a href="https://github.com/Xytabich/PomDrafts/blob/main/src/Common/IDraftsDescriptor.cs"><code>IDraftsDescriptor</code></a> interface in <code>CollectibleBehavior</code>.</p>
<p>The mod implements the "pomdrafts:draft" behavior, which adds a way to describe a draft.</p>

<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>shape</code> - describes the shape of a draft, where each line in a list is a row, and each letter is a cell. If the letter is not in the list of cells, then it is considered as an empty space.</li>
	<li><code>cells</code> - a list of cell types, the key being the letter used in the shape. May have <code>inputs</code>/<code>outputs</code> parameters describing the type of port on each side.</li>
	<li><code>texture</code> - path to the draft texture, the texture is stretched over the entire area of the shape.</li>
	<li><code>color</code> - cells color, white by default.</li>
	<li><code>groups</code> - used to group by sections in the drafting table.</li>
</ul>
