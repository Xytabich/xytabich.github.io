<h3>Connections of drafts</h3>
<p>Drafts have "ports" to connect to each other on the canvas. A port can be either an input or an output. Ports have different types, and only ports of the same type can connect to each other.</p>
<p>The type of ports is also called the connection type, and the list of such types is determined through the config file.</p>
<p>Connections are added via the <code>assets/{modid}/config/pomdrafts/connections.json</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
[
	{
		"code": "CONNECTION_TYPE",
		"textures": {
			"input": "...",
			"output": "...",
			"connected": "..."
		}
	}
]
</code></pre>
<p>The connection has 3 state textures: <code>input</code>, <code>output</code> and <code>connected</code>. <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> are displayed when a draft is not connected to an adjacent one. <code>connected</code> is displayed when there are inputs and outputs directed at each other.</p>
<p>The textures do not rotate depending on the direction of the port, take this into account when creating textures.</p>
