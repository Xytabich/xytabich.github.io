<h3>Drafting Table</h3>
<p>A drafting table is a 'craft table' on which a drawing is made and then assembled using various items and tools.</p>

<img src="table.png" class="page-limit">
<ol>
	<li>List of all learned drafts. Drafts can be grouped, and the side buttons can be used to switch between groups. Search supports special modes:
		<ul>
			<li><code>@modid</code> - search for draft from mod with provided modid.</li>
			<li><code>#group</code> - search for a draft that is in a group (currently only one group is supported).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Canvas with drawing. A draft is added by holding LMB on any draft in the left list and dragging it onto the canvas. A draft is deleted by dragging it from the canvas to the left list. Drafts can be rotated and positioned anywhere on the canvas.</li>
	<li>Preview of the required items for the drawing and its assembly result. Appears only when a suitable recipe has been found for the drawing drawn up on the canvas. If there are multiple recipes for the same drawing, they will switch on a timer. Hovering the cursor over this area will stop switching, and a mouse wheel can be used to manually cycle through all available recipes.</li>
	<li>Slots for crafting ingredients and result.</li>
</ol>
<p>This interface also simplifies the creation of recipes. Clicking the 'Make recipe json' button will copy the recipe to the clipboard (works only in creative).</p>
