<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Xytabich/Glassmaking" target="_blank">Github page.</a></p>
<p>
	This modification adds the craft of glass blowing to the game: melting, blowing, molding and processing glass products.
</p>
<p>At the moment there are 2 ways to create products:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blowing - with the help of a special pipe and tools, you can give any rounded glass shape.</li>
	<li>Molding - the glass is blown into a pre-prepared shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The modification also adds glass typing, so you can use many types and colors of glass in one recipe.
</p>
<p>
	The product resulting from blowing or molding must be annealed to remove internal stresses.
